# Hi! 👋

I'm Federico, a Master's student in Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome 🇮🇹 with a passion for Data Science 📊 and soccer ⚽. My dream is to combine these interests professionally leveraging data-driven insights in sports analytics.

Currently, I'm working as a Research Assistant at DigiLab Sapienza 🏺, and I'm expanding my horizons through an Erasmus+ Exchange Program in Oslo 🇳🇴.
