The Epigraphic Database Roma (EDR) stands as
the most comprehensive and precise collection of Ancient Roman
inscriptions, boasting over one hundred thousand entries curated
by the International Federation of Epigraphic Databases. Given
that the dating of these inscriptions span across centuries,
many have suffered from erosion, resulting in missing text. Our
objective is to reconstruct these lost segments. To achieve this,
we plan to fine-tune LatinBERT, the leading language model
for Latin, using the EDR database. This process will yield a
specialized language model adept at filling in the gaps within
these ancient texts. This advanced model represents a stepping
stone in language models trained on inscriptions.
